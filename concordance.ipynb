    "`nltk` has a built-in function called `FreqDist` which counts up how many times each word in a text occurs. So, if you have a list called `words` which contains all the words in a book, you can find the frequencies of all of them by writing `freq = nltk.FreqDist(words)`. You can then get the e.g. ten most common words by writing `freq.most_common(10)`. What are the ten most common words in Jane Austen's \"Emma\"? What about Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\"?"

That is why we often remove \"stopwords\", that is, a list of the most common words in English, before e.g. counting frequencies. There are several of these lists available, in [English]((https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280)) as well as other languages, such as [Danish](https://gist.github.com/berteltorp/0cf8a0c7afea7f25ed754f24cfc2467b).
